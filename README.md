# Playstation Calendar Application

This is a web application created for a take-home assessment given by Playstation for a UI Engineer position.

# Running the application

Please run the app by navigating to [https://coreybyrum.com/playstation-calendar/](https://coreybyrum.com/playstation-calendar/). You may need to hit refresh.

# Goal

The goal of this assignment is to allow our team to evaluate your mastery of JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and other aspects of UI engineering.

# About

Provided information: You should be able to demonstrate your calendar application including running your tests, explaining your decision making, and any other relevant talking points.

Initially, I was under the impression I needed to create a calendar application. After opening the provided zip file, I realized there was an implicit requirement to integrate the assets.

**The application was completed in 2.5 days and is very limited.** However, it displays a catalog on the left of **all** assets. Hovering over an asset, will show more detailed information via a transitional card living beneath the original.

The header contains a way to traverse the months of 2019. **The application currently only displays months for 2019**. There is a button, 'Today', that allows the user to immediately revert to the current day on the calendar.

Selecting an individual day, will show you the assets, and their respective information, for that particular day. The information displays beneath the calendar.

# If I had more time

- Responsive design. I would have added media queries and limited min/max widths throughout the project. 
- Catalog filters. I would have liked to add more filters for the catalog of assets displaying on the left side of the page. Perhaps a search bar, filter by game type, filter by date.. etc.
- Selecting an asset. I would have liked to create another module or page, that opened upon clicking on an asset in the catalog. This module or page, could have then display further information or provided action items such as purchase or begin/start.
- Added more years. Perhaps I would have integrated a calendar API or added a year filter.
- No month carousel. I would have liked to hide/display the months on prev/next selection, as opposed to creating the absolute positioned months like a carousel.
- Session storage. I would have liked to actually save created events. Either in the cache or some db server.
